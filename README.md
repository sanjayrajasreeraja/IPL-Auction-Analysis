# IPL-Auction-Analysis
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, attracting top cricket players from around the world.
The IPL auction is a crucial event where teams bid to acquire players for the upcoming season.

In this project, I have analysed the data of the IPL2024 auction from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/ipl-players-sold-2024/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.
